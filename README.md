This still needs significant work, but the main objective is to quantify in-game performance for hitters.  

There are two categories that quantify how a hitter performs in this model: Performance Score and Plate Discipline Score.  

The Performance Score calculates wOBA, AVG Exit Velocity, Barrel %, EV 95 MPH + %, and LA between 10-30 % for each batter and gives each a ranking based on how they performed compared to the rest of the hitters.  They are then assigned a score from 1-50(50 being the best) based on the rankings.

The Plate Discipline Score calculates Chase %, Whiff %, IZ Whiff %, FB Whiff %, and Offspeed Chase % for each batter and gives each a ranking based on how they performed compared to the rest of the hitters.  They are then assigned a score from 1-50(50 being the best) based on the rankings.

The Final Game Score is calculated by combining the Performance Score and Plate Discipline Score.
